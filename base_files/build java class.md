Excellent choice. Java with JavaFX and PostgreSQL is a robust combination for building a standalone salary calculation application. This stack offers strong typing, cross-platform compatibility, and a powerful relational database.
Let's outline a basic structure for your application:

1 Java with JavaFX for the frontend and application logic
2 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to PostgreSQL
3 PostgreSQL for data storage

Here's a simple example to get you started:

file xxx

This example provides a basic JavaFX application that:

Allows input of employee name and base salary
Lets you select a month
Calculates the salary (currently just returns the base salary)
Saves the data to a PostgreSQL database

To use this code, you'll need to:

Set up a PostgreSQL database and create a table for salaries:

CREATE TABLE salaries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    month VARCHAR(20),
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2)
);   

Add the necessary dependencies to your project:

JavaFX (if you're using Java 11 or later)
PostgreSQL JDBC driver


Replace DB_URL, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD with your actual database credentials.
Implement more complex salary calculation logic as needed.

This provides a starting point for your application. You can expand on this by adding features like:

Employee management
More detailed salary components (allowances, deductions, etc.)
Reporting and data visualization
Data export functionality

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this code or explain how to set up the PostgreSQL database in more detail?
